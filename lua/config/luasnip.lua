-- Beside defining your own snippets you can also load snippets from "vscode-like" packages
-- that expose snippets in json files, for example <https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets>.

-- The directories will have to be structured like eg. <https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets> (include
-- a similar `package.json`)

require("luasnip.loaders.from_vscode").load( )
-- Load snippets from my-snippets folder

-- You can also use lazy loading so snippets are loaded on-demand, not all at once (may interfere with lazy-loading luasnip itself).
