## The P Is For Personal

A personal development environment, or PDE, differs from an integrated development environment primarily in that it
is _personal_. A PDE is a living thing, continuously configured and extended over the years by someone who thinks the 
time sent building your own teools if well spent. 

This is not a framework meant to help someone hit the ground running, it is my personal configuration. You should take, 
ideas from it assuming some appeal to, and you should be doing that from many places in order to build _your personal_ development
environment.  



## Functionality

_The major features and capabilities of the PDE's default distribution._


### VS Code Compatibility

These features are directly compatible with components of VS Code.  

- __Graphical Debugger__
	- Implements VS Code's [Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/).  
	- Evaluate under cursor (or hover) and virtual text display
	- Compatible with `launch.json`
	- Easily install new debug adapters
- __Task Automation__ compatible with `tasks.json`
- __Snippets__ 
	- Compatible with `snippets.json`
	- Includes snippets from several VS Code snippet extensions by defaults
- __Icons__ (from VS Code)
	- File Icons 
	- Language-specific LSP signs in menus and tab bar
- __Command Palette__ - most functionality is available through an extensible command pallete

> _In order to correctly display all of the various glyphs, you will want to install a pached font._
>	`brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts`
>	`brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font`

---

### Keybindings

- Easy and logical method for assigning keybindings
- Inline (zero overhead) help remembering or discovering keybindings
- Complete (including native keybindings) and searchable legend

---

### Auto-Completion

Includes __Path intellisense__ and __command-mode__ (`:`) completion.  

Auto-complete is highly configurable and supports many sources:  

- Language server
- Current Buffer
- Git 
- Ripgrep
- Github Copilot
- Treesitter

---

### Source Control Management

- Show changes in the sign column (gutter)
- Local git repo integrations including _Stage/Unstage_ chunk
- Github integration (PRs, issues)
- Blame and commit messages for current line

---

### Language Support

There are several language servers installed by default. You can easily add/remove additonal
language servers using `:LSPInstall`. 

_Enable/Disable_ installed language servers using the config at `lua/lsp/servers.lua`.  

- Ansible
- Bash
- CSS
- Dockerfile
- Javascript
- Lua
- Markdown
- Python
- Rust
- TOML
- Terraform
- Typescript
- Vimscript
- YAML
- HTML


> __LSP Capabilities__
>
> - Auto-completion Source
> - (Automatic) Formatting and Linting
> - Go To definition (preview available)
> - Find All References (preview available)
> - Callstack
> - Code Outline
> - Symbol Outline
> - Signature Help
> - Preview Definition
> - Recommended Code Actions/Fixes

---

### Convenience Features

- Color highlight (by hex value)
- Integrated personal wiki and cheatsheet editor
- Intergation with Dash.app (API documentation app for macOS)
- Powerful find and replace tool
- Extremely fast code search tool
- Innovative fast navigation tool based on the idea that in most cases for a given project, we are frequently returning
  the same set of 4-5 files

---

### Easily discoverable commands and documentation
- All default and custom keybindings are automatically added to the command palette
- Customizable quick cheatsheet
- Integrated personal wiki 
- Integrated with Dash.app or devdocs.io documentation sources
- Easy user-level customizations

## Cheatsheets and Custom help
_Store some of your notes here in the custom help docs: `doc/halp`. To update help keywords for searching:_

```vim
:helptags ~/.config/nvim/docs/
```

Add entries to the cheatsheet by editing `cheatsheet.txt`. The `:Cheatsheet` command will allow searching the cheatsheet
using telescope. `:Cheatsheet!` will open in a popup window.
